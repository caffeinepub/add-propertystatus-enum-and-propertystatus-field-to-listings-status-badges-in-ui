  "summary": "REQ-8 asks to explicitly default `Listing.propertyStatus` to `#available` in every listing-creation code path in `backend/main.mo`. The diff snippet shows the `PropertyStatus` type and `Listing.propertyStatus` field definition, but the provided truncated diff does not show any listing-creation functions or record-construction sites where `propertyStatus = #available` is actually set. An additional modification to `project_state.json` appears unrelated to the requested backend-only defaulting change.",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Ensure that every code path that creates a new `Listing` record in `backend/main.mo` explicitly sets `propertyStatus` to `#available` at creation time (so newly created listings never have an unset or non-available initial `propertyStatus`).",
      "reason": "The truncated `backend/main.mo` diff shows the `propertyStatus : PropertyStatus` field exists on `Listing`, but does not provide evidence of any listing creation/insert/update code paths explicitly assigning `propertyStatus = #available` when constructing new `Listing` records (including any demo/seed logic).",
