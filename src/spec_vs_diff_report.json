  "summary": "The diff updates Header/Footer/index.html to reference the new generated logo/icon filenames and adds developer-facing comments documenting those paths. However, no actual logo/image asset files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, so the core asset-generation/export requirements are not implemented. Additionally, frontend-file-summaries.txt claims a large set of unrelated UI/features not requested in the BuildRequest.",
