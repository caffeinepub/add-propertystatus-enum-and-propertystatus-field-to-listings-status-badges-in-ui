  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that new Listing creation paths in `backend/main.mo` now explicitly set `propertyStatus = #available`. Additionally, `project_state.json` was modified, which violates the constraint to only change Listing creation-time defaulting in `backend/main.mo`.",

      "requirement": "Update the backend listing creation logic in `backend/main.mo` so that whenever a new `Listing` record is created, it explicitly sets `propertyStatus = #available` across every code path that constructs/stores a new `Listing`.",
      "reason": "The provided truncated `backend/main.mo` excerpt only shows type/record definitions (including `PropertyStatus` and `Listing.propertyStatus`) and does not show any listing-construction code paths being updated to explicitly assign `propertyStatus = #available` at creation time. With the diff truncated, there is insufficient evidence that the creation logic was updated as required.",

      "reason": "The request scope is limited to setting `propertyStatus = #available` at creation time and forbids other modifications. The truncated diff excerpt for `backend/main.mo` prominently includes `PropertyStatus` and `propertyStatus` in the `Listing` record, which may indicate additional changes beyond creation-time assignment; however, due to truncation, it cannot be confirmed what exactly changed.",
